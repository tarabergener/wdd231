        <h3>Site Name: SPINflip Gaming</h3>
        <p>The name was derived from my son who likes to play video games. SpinFlip comes from many actions that are performed when playing video games.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Site Purpose: </h3>
        <p>The purpose of my website is to be informational about upcoming local gaming events and other games coming out. It is meant to be a site where people can navigate to when they want to know the latest in gaming. It will feature game ads, local events page, an about page, local weather, and a page leading to game descriptions and so on.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Scenarios:</h3>  
        <p>1. What upcoming gaming events are in my area?</p>
        <p>2.	What games are coming out soon?</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Color Schema:</h3>
        <p>The color schema is going to feature different shades of green along with a black background as is common with most gaming websites. It will help with the contrast that is going to be seen with all of the gaming ads and pictures. The nav bar will likely feature a black background with green words.</p>
